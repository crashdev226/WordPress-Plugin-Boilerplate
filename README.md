# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate with Namespace and Autoloader Support

This is a fork of the original WordPress Plugin Boilerplate project with added namespace and Autoloader support. Requires PHP 5.6 and greater.
## Contents

The `plugin-name` directory that contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Features

* The Boilerplate is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to change.
* The Boilerplate uses a strict file organization scheme that corresponds both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure, and that makes it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.
* The project includes a `.pot` file as a starting point for internationalization.

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". You will want to rename it and the classes inside of it to fit your needs.

Note that this will activate the source code of the Boilerplate, but because the Boilerplate has no real functionality there will be no menu items, meta boxes, or custom post types added.

## History

The original launch of this version of the boilerplate included the folder structure needed for using your plugin on WordPress.org. That folder structure has been moved to its own repo here: https://github.com/DevinVinson/Plugin-Directory-Boilerplate

### Plugin Structure

If you want to include your own classes, or third-party libraries

* `plugin-name/inc/admin` - admin-specific functionality
* `plugin-name/inc/core` - plugin core to register hooks, load files etc
* `plugin-name/inc/public-view` - public-facing functionality
* `plugin-name/inc/common` - functionality shared between the admin area and the public-facing parts

## PHP Version
Requires PHP `5.6.0` or greater

## Recommended Tools

### i18n Tools

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the Boilerplate. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin.
